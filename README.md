# GatherTalk-2
a continuation of gathertalk for testing ðŸ†’ things


so basically in 2023 my friends and i participated in a web design competition and since we didnt rlly know much about the competition my friend decided to make a non static page but we didnt win anything and it took him a long time to implement the backend since we had no prior experience and I just made a html page (technically I did 20% of one html page). The orginal gathertalk was written in node js and used mongodb
then the next year I decided to make a web app while learning cybersecurity so I decided to use the name gathertalk 2. this is a terribly designed web app written in flask and uses a postgre database. theres no log in page for now (or maybe there is but i didnt update the readme).
